# SMS Spam Detection using RNN

## Description
A deep learning-based model for **binary classification** of SMS messages using a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**. The model tokenizes, pads, and processes text data, then applies an **embedding layer** followed by **SimpleRNN** and dense layers for classification. Trained using labeled data, it predicts whether a message is **spam (1) or ham (0)** with optimized accuracy.
